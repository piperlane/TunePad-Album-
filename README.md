# TunePad-Album-
For my A2 project prototype, i created an album of four different songs on TunePad. I sought inspiration from the classic sounds of Chicargo house music in the 1970s.

# General Infomation 
I chose to undertake this project as i wanted to challenge myself through learning a new platform and its structures. I had no previous experince working with code or producing music, so i was really stepping out of my comfort zone with this project. House music is my favourite genre, so i sought inspiration from the classic and original sounds of the genre. 

# Technologies Used 
I used the coding environment of TunePad to constuct my album. TunePad allows users to create short musical loops, which can be layered together using digital audio workstations. The platform uses python as its primary language, which is a computer programming language developed in the 1990s. 

# Features 
Across the four different songs i composed, a variety of code functions were used. Those of which include: 
- playNote
- Velocity, beats, rest and sustain
- Loops
- getPlayhead and getMeasure
- With transpose
- Stutter patterns
- Low pass filter
- With pan

# Setup 
Prior to undertaking this project, i completed a range of tutorials, provided on the TunePad website to assit me in understanding the structure and functions of the platform. TunePad is a free online platform which is accessible to anyone with an internet connection. 

# Usage 
A range of different code functions can be used in TunePad, which all produce different outcomes. . Some of which include: 
- playNote(28, beats = 2, velocity = 80, sustain = 2)
- for i in range(4): 
    playNote(4, beats = 0.25/2)
- with pan(value = [-1.0, 1.0], beats = 3):
    playNote(36, beats = 3)
- with lowpass(frequency = [200, 800, 200, 800, 200, 800], beats=1):
    playNote(47, beats=3)
  
# Project Status 
The album is currently complete. 

# Room for Improvement 
Across my prototype there is definatley room for improvement. As this was my first time creating code, more advanced functions, longer streams of code and layering of instruments could have be utilised. 

# Acknowledgements 
The tutorials provided on the TunePad website were incredibly useful for generating ideas and helping understand how the platform works. Additionally the book,'Introduction to digital music with python programming' by Michalel Horn has been extremely benefical when understanding the theory and meaning behind code.
