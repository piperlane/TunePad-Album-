# General Infomation 
I chose to undertake this project as i wanted to challenge myself through learning a new platform and its structures. I had no previous experince working with code or producing music, so i was really stepping out of my comfort zone with this project. House music is my favourite genre, so i sought inspiration from the classic and original sounds of the genre. 

# Technologies Used 
I used the coding environment of TunePad to constuct my album. TunePad allows users to create short musical loops, which can be layered together using digital audio workstations. The platform uses python as its primary language, which is a computer programming language developed in the 1990s. 

# Features 
Across the four different songs i composed, a variety of code functions were used. Those of which include: 
- playNote
- Velocity, beats, rest and sustain
- Loops
- getPlayhead and getMeasure
- With transpose
- Stutter patterns
- Low pass filter
- With pan
